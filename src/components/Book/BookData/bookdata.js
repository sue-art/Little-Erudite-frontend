      publishedDate: "2019-05-07",
      description:
        "The definitive, fascinating, all-reaching biography of Dr. Seuss Dr. Seuss is a classic American icon. Whimsical and wonderful, his work has defined our childhoods and the childhoods of our own children. The silly, simple rhymes are a bottomless well of magic, his illustrations timeless favorites because, quite simply, he makes us laugh. The Grinch, the Cat in the Hat, Horton, and so many more, are his troupe of beloved, and uniquely Seussian, creations. Theodor Geisel, however, had a second, more radical side. It is there that the allure and fasciation of his Dr. Seuss alter ego begins. He had a successful career as an advertising man and then as a political cartoonist, his personal convictions appearing, not always subtly, throughout his books—remember the environmentalist of The Lorax? Geisel was a complicated man on an important mission. He introduced generations to the wonders of reading while teaching young people about empathy and how to treat others well. Agonizing over word choices and rhymes, touching up drawings sometimes for years, he upheld a rigorous standard of perfection for his work. Geisel took his responsibility as a writer for children seriously, talking down to no reader, no matter how small. And with classics like Green Eggs and Ham, and One Fish Two Fish Red Fish Blue Fish, Geisel delighted them while they learned. Suddenly, reading became fun.

        "Since Theodor Geisel published his first children's book in 1937 under the pseudonym Dr. Seuss, children and adults alike have been captivated by the charming and laconic tales of whimsical characters and imaginative worlds. But Dr. Seuss' stories are more than just catchy poems; they often wrestle with serious philosophical and moral dilemmas, whether it is Horton discovering the very essence of life or the Lorax teaching us about morality. Dr. Seuss and Philosophy explores philosophical concepts such as the nature of the good life in Oh, the Places You'll Go!, the nature of knowledge in McElligot's Pool, postmodernity in On Beyond Zebra, business and the environment in The Lorax, and moral character in How the Grinch Stole Christmas!, among many others. Anyone who loves Dr. Seuss or is interested in philosophy will find this book to be intriguing and enlightening.",

      description:
        "Pick a pet with Dr. Seuss with this bestselling and silly tail of cats, dogs and more! A dog or a cat? A fish or a bird? Or maybe a crazy creature straight from the mind of Dr. Seuss! Which pet would YOU get? A trip to the pet store turns into a hilarious struggle when two kids must choose one pet to take home... but everytime they think they see an animal they like, they find something even better! Perfect for animal lovers and Seuss lover alike, this book will delight readers young and old. Discovered 22 years after Dr. Seuss's death, the unpublished manuscript and sketches for What Pet Should I Get? were previously published as a 48-page jacketed hardcover with 8 pages of commentary. This unjacketed Beginner Book edition features the story only. The cat? Or the dog? The kitten? The pup? Oh, boy! It is something to make a mind up. Originally created by Dr. Seuss himself, Beginner Books are fun, funny, and easy to read. These unjacketed hardcover early readers encourage children to read all on their own, using simple words and illustrations. Smaller than the classic large format Seuss picture books like The Lorax and Oh, The Places You’ll Go!, these portable packages are perfect for practicing readers ages 3-7, and lucky parents too!",

        "Horton, Thidwick, Yertle, the Lorax, the Grinch, Sneetches, and the Cat in the Hat are just a handful of the bizarre and beloved characters Theodor S. Geisel (1904–1991), alias Dr. Seuss, created in his forty-seven children's books, from 1937's And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street to 1990's Oh, the Places You'll Go! During his lifetime Dr. Seuss was honored with numerous degrees, three Academy Awards, and a Pulitzer, but the man himself remained a reclusive enigma. In this first and only biography of the good doctor, the authors, his close friends for almost thirty years, have drawn on their firsthand insights as well as his voluminous papers; the result is an illuminating, intimate portrait of a dreamer who saw the world \"through the wrong end of a telescope,\" and invited us to enjoy the view.",

        "Theodor Seuss Geisel—known worldwide as the beloved children’s author Dr. Seuss—produced a body of work that spans more than 70 years. Though most often associated with children’s books, he frequently contributed cartoons and humorous essays to popular magazines, produced effective and memorable advertising campaigns (“Quick, Henry, the Flit!”), and won Oscars and Emmys for motion picture productions, animated shorts, and features. As founder and president of Beginner Books, his influence on children’s book publishing was revolutionary, especially in the field of elementary readers. Geisel’s prolific career—he wrote or contributed illustrations to more than 75 books, most of which have been reprinted repeatedly and translated worldwide—and his predilection for made-up creatures make this joint bibliography and iconography especially useful to readers and researchers. The exhaustive bibliography is arranged chronologically, providing full bibliographic information, including translations as they appear, reissue information, and descriptions of the binding. The iconography links more than 900 fictional names, places and terms to the works in which they appear. For the reader seeking a first edition of Quomodo Invidiosulus Nomine Grinchus Christi Natalem Abrogaverit (How the Grinch Stole Christmas! translated into Latin) or hoping to identify “abrasion-contusions” (race cars in If I Ran the Circus!), this work promises as much discovery as a walk down Mulberry Street.",

        "This enhanced eBook features read-along narration. Winner: CLC Seal of Approval 2017 Literary Classics Book Awards, Silver, Preschool/Early Reader Fantasy Finalist: 2017 Literary Classics Book Awards 2017 PNBA Long-List When Ethan looks under the bed for his monster, he finds this note instead: \"So long, kid. Gotta go. Someone needs me more than you do. –Gabe\" How will Ethan ever get to sleep without his monster's familiar, comforting snorts? And who could need Gabe more than Ethan does? Gabe must have gone to Ethan's little sister's room! She has been climbing out of bed every night to play, and obviously needs a monster to help her get to sleep – but not HIS monster! Ethan tries to help his sister find her own monster, but none are the perfect blend of cute and creepy. Just when it seems that Ethan will lose his monster forever, an uninvited, tutu-toting little monster full of frightening fun appears. Following in the spooky-silly tradition of I Need My Monster, here's another irresistible monster-under-the-bed story with the perfect balance of giggles and shivers.",

        "What if a wimpy kid was born in the Stone Age? Turning thirteen is when caveboys miraculously change from skinny, hairless, squeaky-voiced cowards (like me) to thick-browed, hair-covered, deep-grunting cavemen (like my best friend Ug). That’s when we’re tested. It’s called the Arrival. You’re supposed to disappear into the woods and return with something big, dangerous or rare – preferably all three. Except I can’t even lift a club above my shoulder. Even with my friends Ug and Saleeka trying to teach me to hunt, I don’t have a chance. If I fail the Arrival, there’ll be an extra line on my family’s stone tablet saying: Helix was banished to the Dark Side because he was a massive embarrassment to his family, as well as any self-respecting caveman on the mountain. So my story might as well end here, but I’ll keep telling it anyway. Charcoal meat on a stick, anyone?",

        "Named one of the Best Crime Books of the Year by the Guardian , Weirdo is an atmospheric thriller about a teenage girl convicted of murder in a 1980s seaside town and the private investigator who reopens the case to discover that she may not have acted alone ... Corinne Woodrow was fifteen when she was convicted of the ritualistic murder of her classmate in a quaint seaside town. It was 1984, a year when teenagers ran wild, dressed in black, stayed out all night, and listened to music that terrified their parents. Rumours of Satanism surrounded Corinne and she was locked up indefinitely, a chilling reminder to the parents of Ernemouth to keep a watchful eye on their children. Twenty years later, private investigator Sean Ward — whose promising career as a detective with the Metropolitan Police was cut short by a teenager with a gun — reopens the case after new forensic evidence suggests that Corinne didn’t act alone. His investigation uncovers a town full of secrets, and a community that has always looked after its own.",

      description:
        'In 2006, a child was born and left to die in a banana plantation in the central Vietnamese province of Quang Nam. When he was found three days later, he was barely alive. His right leg, testicles and penis had been eaten by wild animals. Local monks named him Thien Nhan, meaning "charity and goodness."The boy was soon adopted by Hanoian magazine editor Tran Mai Anh, who began the long process of consulting with doctors both within Vietnam and abroad, seeking treatment for her son in the hopes of providing him with the life of a normal boy.The story of Thien Nhan\'s journey has moved countless supporters who have donated to the costs of his medical procedures around the world. A charity in his name now supports many Vietnamese children suffering from genital loss. Thien Nhan is now an official Goodwill Ambassador who represents the needs of many young children who suffer from genital defects or loss of genitals due to traumatic incidents and are in need of life-changing support and assistance.This book, translated from the original Vietnamese by friends of Thien Nhan, tells the story of his long path to healing in the words of his adopted mother and grandmother. It speaks to the enduring power of love to overcome what seems impossible.',

        "Theodor Seuss Geisel—known worldwide as the beloved children’s author Dr. Seuss—produced a body of work that spans more than 70 years. Though most often associated with children’s books, he frequently contributed cartoons and humorous essays to popular magazines, produced effective and memorable advertising campaigns (“Quick, Henry, the Flit!”), and won Oscars and Emmys for motion picture productions, animated shorts, and features. As founder and president of Beginner Books, his influence on children’s book publishing was revolutionary, especially in the field of elementary readers. Geisel’s prolific career—he wrote or contributed illustrations to more than 75 books, most of which have been reprinted repeatedly and translated worldwide—and his predilection for made-up creatures make this joint bibliography and iconography especially useful to readers and researchers. The exhaustive bibliography is arranged chronologically, providing full bibliographic information, including translations as they appear, reissue information, and descriptions of the binding. The iconography links more than 900 fictional names, places and terms to the works in which they appear. For the reader seeking a first edition of Quomodo Invidiosulus Nomine Grinchus Christi Natalem Abrogaverit (How the Grinch Stole Christmas! translated into Latin) or hoping to identify “abrasion-contusions” (race cars in If I Ran the Circus!), this work promises as much discovery as a walk down Mulberry Street.",

The ever popular Lorax tells the tale of the wicked Once-ler who devastates a beautiful paradise by cutting down all the Truffula Trees, just so he can knit thneeds that noboby needs. The message is loud and clear that we should take better care of our environment. Learning to face up to life's problems - rather than trying to run away from them - is the message amusingly told in I Had Trouble in Getting to Solla Sollew, and Did I Ever Tell You How Lucky You Are? reminds us all that there is always someone, somewhere, worse off than ourselves.",

        "A Step 3 Biography Reader about Theodor Geisel and his transformation from a doodler into the beloved Dr. Seuss. Little Ted Geisel always had a sketchpad and pencil in hand. He was a Boy Scout with a penchant for creating zany creatures. He grew up with a love of books and words from his mother, and his inventor father spawned a wildly imaginative and perfectionist side. It’s no wonder that these qualities led to the beloved work of Dr. Seuss, the Great Doodler. Follow his career as an ad man, political cartoonist, creator of forty-five indelible children’s books, and Pulitzer Prize winner. Not bad for a lifelong doodler! Includes fun facts and several of Dr. Seuss’s original sketches and artwork! Selected as one of the Best Children’s Books of the Year-2017, by the Bank Street College of Education and Children’s Book Committee! Step 3 Readers feature engaging characters in easy-to-follow plots about popular topics. For children who are ready to read on their own.",

      description:
        "A children’s book for adults in the vein of the mega-bestselling Go the F**k to Sleep, The Kid in the Crib brilliantly reimagines the Dr. Seuss classic, The Cat in the Hat, for beleaguered parents struggling with the anxieties and challenges of parenting in the 21st century. It substitutes the typical worries, frustrations, and challenges of modern parenting for Seuss's original story about a kindly feline and the children he befriends. It lays out the daily power struggle between parents as they each insist that it's the other one's turn to deal with the befouled diaper, and the bleary-headedness that coincides with an infant's sleeping patterns. Parents will chuckle as they read \"The kid spat up white/The kid spat up green/The kid spat up more spit up/Than we'd ever seen.\" This pitch-perfect parody—expertly illustrated by graphic designer Felix Schlater—paints an honest portrait of parenting that will have moms and dads nodding in recognition and howling with laughter. And it is a story that parents will delight in reading, both to each other--and even to their kids someday.",

        "Here, combined in one volume, are ten of Dr. Seuss's tallest tales, taken from three of his best-loved storybooks -- The Sneetches, Yurtle the Turtle, and I Can Lick 30 Tigers Today Packed with zany pictures and hilarious rhymes, the tales make enchanting bedtime reading. Children will be tickled pink to meet the Star-Bellied Sneetches -- whose bellies bear stars -- and their rivals the Plain-Bellied Sneetches -- who have none upon thars Or King Looie Katz, king of Zatzen-stein, who makes his courtiers follow him round so his beautiful tail won't drag on the ground. Then there is the little sister who thunks a glunk in The Glunk That Got Thunk and gets more than she bargained for. Or the stubborn Zax who would rather have highways built over them than budge in their tracks. With Dr. Seuss's unique combination of outlandish storytelling and bold illustrations, these and a host of other characters are hilariously brought to life in this wonderful book.",

Imagine living in a 13-storey treehouse that includes a secret underground laboratory, self-making beds, a vegetable vaporiser and a marshmallow machine that shoots marshmallows into your mouth? Well Andy and Terry are lucky enough to live in one, where they have a series of completely mad adventures. And today Andy and Terry manage to get their dates all mixed up. They thought that they were going to rehearse their new play, The 13-Storey Treehouse, except they forgot to write it! And to make matters worse, they need to find flying cats, a mermaid, a sea monster, an invasion of monkeys, and a giant gorilla! Despite not having any of these things, they do have a box of costumes and props, some pretty awesome technology and friends to help out!",

        "There are lots of laughs at every level in The 143-Storey Treehouse, the eleventh book in the number one bestselling Treehouse series from Andy Griffiths and Terry Denton. We've added thirteen new levels to our Treehouse (it used to be 130 storeys, but it keeps on growing!) including a word-o-matic (it knows every word in the whole world!); a recycling depot; a wrecking ball; a deep, dark cave with a real live, fire-breathing dragon; a complaining room; a spooky graveyard (where it's always midnight, even in the middle of the day); and a camping ground where you can have a nice, relaxing camping holiday. Andy's been a bit stressed, so Terry has decided the perfect way for them to relax is to head up to their new camping ground level for a much-needed holiday. But it turns out to be not quite as relaxing as Terry originally planned. . . Terry forgets to pack the tent and the food, their attempt at fishing ends in disaster, the spooky campfire stories are a little too spooky and then, to make matters worse, all of Andy’s fellow campers start mysteriously disappearing. Can Andy brave the dark, dark woods and rescue them in time to finish writing their next book? Well, what are you waiting for? Come on up!",

They've added a chocolate waterfall you can swim in, a volcano for toasting marshmallows, a bulldozer-battling level, a baby-dinosaur-petting zoo, a not-very-merry merry-go-round, a boxing elephant called the Trunkinator, an X-ray room, a disco with light-up dance floor, the world's scariest roller coaster and a top-secret thirty-ninth level which hasn't even been finished yet! And this year Terry has created the greatest invention that he—or anyone else—has ever invented . . . a Once-upon-a-time machine that will write and illustrate their entire book for them!

        'New York Times-bestselling team Andy Griffiths and Terry Denton invite readers to come hang out with them in their 117-Story Treehouse—the ninth book in the illustrated chapter book series filled with Andy and Terry\'s signature slapstick humor! Andy and Terry live in a 117-story treehouse. (It used to be a 104-story treehouse, but it just keeps growing!) It now has a pajama-party room, a water-ski park filled with flesh-eating piranhas, an Underpants Museum, a giant-fighting-robot arena, and the Door of Doom (don’t open it or you’ll be COMPLETELY and UTTERLY DOOMED!). For as long as Andy and Terry have been writing books together, Andy has always been the narrator and Terry has always been the illustrator. But when Terry tries to prove that he can narrate as well as draw, the story goes completely out of control and the Story Police arrive to arrest the whole treehouse team for crimes against storytelling! Andy, Terry and Jill go on the run, but how long can they evade the Story Police and stay out of Story Jail? Praise for Andy Griffiths and the Treehouse series: "Anarchic absurdity at its best. . . . Denton\'s manic cartooning captures every twist and turn in hilarious detail." —Publishers Weekly, starred review, on The 13-Story Treehouse "Will appeal to fans of Jeff Kinney and Dav Pilkey. . . . The wonderfully random slapstick humor is tailor-made for reluctant readers. . . . A treat for all." —Booklist on The 13-Story Treehouse Read the whole series!

        "The 26-Storey Treehouse: Colour Edition is the second book in the bestselling Treehouse series by Andy Griffith's and Terry Denton! This laugh-out-loud story is packed with and told through fantastic comic book style illustrations – perfect for fans of Dog Man and Bunny vs. Monkey. 'The kind of book I would have loved as a kid' – Tom Fletcher, author of The Danger Gang. Andy and Terry have expanded their treehouse! There are now thirteen brand-new storeys, including a dodgem-car rink, a skate ramp, a mud-fighting arena, an antigravity chamber, an ice-cream parlour with seventy-eight flavours run by an ice-cream-serving robot called Edward Scooperhands, and the Maze of Doom – a maze so complicated that nobody who has gone in has ever come out again . . . Well, not yet anyway. This time, the two friends have a whole week to finish their next book, and Andy even knows what it should be about: the story of how he and Terry first met. But life is NEVER boring in the treehouse, and emergency shark operations, giant storms, and wooden pirate heads are just the beginning . . . Well, what are you waiting for? Come on up! Climb more fun-filled levels in the ten million-copy-selling series – the perfect chapter books for reluctant readers.",

It was the age of invention... It was the season of surprise... It was the eve of supa sadness... It was the dawn of hope... Dog Man hasn't always been a paws-itive addition to the police force. While he can muzzle miscreants, he tends to leave a slick of slobber in his wake! This time, Petey the Cat's dragged in a tiny bit of trouble -- a double in the form of a kitten clone. Dog Man will have to work twice as hard to bust these furballs and remain top dog! Dav Pilkey's wildly popular Dog Man series appeals to readers of all ages and explores universally positive themes, including empathy, kindness, persistence, and the importance of being true to one's self.",

        "New from the creator of Captain Underpants, it's Dog Man, the crime-biting canine who is part dog, part man, and ALL COP! There's a new breed of justice in town, and he's ready to sniff out criminals -- as soon as he stops chasing his own tail! George and Harold have created a new hero who digs into deception, claws after crooks, and rolls over robbers. When Greg the police dog and his cop companion are injured on the job, a life-saving surgery changes the course of history, and Dog Man is born. With the head of a dog and the body of a human, this heroic hound has a real nose for justice. But can he resist the call of the wild to answer the call of duty?",

        "One-Man Dog isn’t really the story of a man and a dog. There’s a pup in it. And several men in it aged ten or thereabouts. But it is mostly an affectionate recapturing of the perilous, yet infinitely delightful world of childhood, done so vividly, with such warmth, one can only conclude that at some time or other Ahmad Kamal must have been a small boy himself. Let the reader be warned, however, that One Man Dog is not a memoir in which the keen edges of reality have been buffed smooth by time. Everything is sharply intact: all the desperate adventures, the disastrous fights, the running skirmishes with parental authority, the frightening brushes with the law, the feverish forays into the world of finance and big business, the ecstatic yearnings that are part of growing up — all are here, in a story to make you look excitedly back into the past and catch your breath at the miracle of your own survival.",

        "\"When you start training your dog (or dating a man), it is a good idea to have three bottom-line rules that you enforce no matter what . . .\" DOGS No sleeping on the bed. No jumping up on people. No eating people's food. MEN Be consistent. Have a sense of humor. Be financially self-sufficient. Hilarious, insightful, witty, and wise, Clare Staples is saying what most women have been thinking. And in Everything I Know About Men I Learned From My Dog, the former model and party girl turned relationship expert proves that what works for the four-legged companion in a woman's life can work equally well for the two-legged variety. Divided into immediately evident categories, such as \"Selecting a Breed\" and \"How to Stay the Boss,\" and packed with good-humored observations and practical advice, Everything I Know About Men I Learned From My Dog is the perfect field guide to any girl's two most complicated companions -- her dog and her man. From choosing the right personality to figuring out your companion's quirks and idiosyncrasies, dog ownership and human relationships can be complex affairs. What do you do when he bares his teeth or is a little clingy? How do you reward him when he is good and scold him when he is naughty? With Clare Staples's simple, clever tips, your relationships with both species will be happier and more successful. DON'T GO FOR LOOKS MAN: Handsome men are never a great bet. Often they have learned to rely on their looks and have not had to develop a personality or sense of humor -- far more important qualities. DOG: Don't choose a dog for looks alone. Looks are only skin-deep -- loyalty, devotion, and eagerness to please and unconditional love are the most wonderful things. DON'T CHANGE YOUR LIFESTYLE MAN: When you first meet your man, don't change anything for him. Don't give up your friends or hobbies. Never cancel anything to be with him. DOG: When you first get a dog, chances are he will whine when you leave him alone, but he'll get used to it and appreciate you more when you spend quality time with him. GIVE POSITIVE REWARDS MAN: When your man does something that you like -- such as brings you a present -- reward him. Give him a treat, spoil him. DOG: All dogs love praise. Train a dog with positive rewards for positive behavior.",

        "A humorous, thoughtful, absorbing narrative about the metaphysical joys of a simple daily task Imagine if Annie Dillard had taken a dog along with her to Tinker Creek. Now imagine Tinker Creek was a New Jersey suburb, and you have an idea of the surprises that await in John Zeaman's book. Humorous, thought-provoking, and playful, Dog Walks Man might also be called Zen and the Art of Dog Walking. Zeaman takes us on a journey from a 'round-the-block fraternity of “dog-walking dupes”—suburban fathers who indulged their children's wish for a dog—to a strange and forbidden wonderland at the edge of town: the New Jersey Meadowlands. Along the way he rediscovers childhood's forgotten “fringe places,” investigates the mysteries of the natural world, and experiences moments of inexplicable joy. Each chapter of Dog Walks Man is a bite-size meditation on the wisdom derived from dogs and dog walking. Woven into the narrative are musings on such familiar dog-walking issues as the war of nerves that precedes each walk (or “w-a-l-k” if your dog is in earshot), the problem of dog-walking monotony, and why dog walkers are always the ones to discover dead bodies. This is also the story of Pete, the prescient standard poodle who begins as the “family glue” and evolves into Zeaman's partner on a journey through an abandoned landscape as alive as any jungle. Above all, Dog Walks Man is about a search for wholeness in an increasingly artificial world. It is about discovering what Thoreau meant when he wrote, in his seminal essay “Walking,” “Life consists with wildness.” Because the truth is, something as simple as walking the dog can open up unexpected worlds. An excerpt In the beginning, I walked around the block. Or a couple of blocks. It didn't seem to matter. That it didn't matter was in itself novel. It had been a long time since I had gone out without any particular destination or direction, without knowing whether I was going to turn left or turn right at the end of the front walk. . . . The simple aimlessness of it made me feel like a kid again. . . . Pete, with his boundless enthusiasm for the outside world, was like the reincarnation of that juvenile self. We'd hit the sidewalk and, like two kids with nothing special to do, spend a half-hour meandering about. We were suburban vagabonds. In the mornings, with the whole world rushing to get somewhere, there was something almost subversive about roaming around with a companion who had no responsibilities. We walked the irregular streets of our hilly town. We each had our compulsions. I revived the childhood aversion to stepping on cracks. Pete made sure that every tree was marked with his scent. . . . At night, Pete and I would escape the sometimes-suffocating sweetness of family life—the pajamas and stories, the smell of toothpaste and sheets, the damp goodnight kisses and prolonged hugs. We'd slip out into the silky night like a pair of teenage boys with high hopes for a Saturday night. We'd walk beneath the streetlights from one pool of light to the next. The people in the houses would drift past the windows like aquarium fish. Pete, with his black coat, was practically invisible in the dark stretches and I would let him off the leash.",

        "At 10.30 p.m. on 12 January 2016 Acting Sergeant Luke Warburton thought he was taking his last breath. A decorated New South Wales Police Officer, the father of three was looking death in the face after a bullet pierced his femoral vein. If it wasn't for the fact that it happened in the Emergency Ward of Sydney's Nepean Hospital, Warburton would probably have been dead already. An hour earlier, he'd walked to his police van with his ever-faithful German shepherd, Chuck, trotting alongside. Later, Luke would be awarded the Commissioner's Valour Award for conspicuous merit and exceptional bravery in the line of duty. He would maintain he was just a copper doing his job. So, too, was Chuck, who was nationally recognised for bringing down Australia's most wanted man, Macolm Naden, after a manhunt lasting more than seven years. Man's Best Friend is Luke and Chuck's story. It's the story of a boy who dreamed of one day being a policeman, of his love for dogs and his time at the NSW Police Dog Unit. It's also the story of an ordinary man and his ordinary dog doing extraordinary things in the line of duty.",

The comic club is going in all different directions! Naomi, Melvin, and siblings are each trying to find their purpose. Naomi has an idea to get rich quick that causes a lot of commotion and emotion. And when faced with rejections, the friends try and try again to stay true to their vision. To top it off, a surprise visitor comes to class to stir things up.

Featured as stories-within-the-story, the mini comics showcase each baby frog's perspective and individual art style.

        'The Cat Kid Comic Club learns to collaborate in this creative, funny, and insightful graphic novel by Dav Pilkey, the author and illustrator of Dog Man. Excitement and imagination run wild as Naomi, Melvin, Poppy, Gilbert, Curly, and their siblings get back to making comics with originality and laughter. But wait -- have they cleaned their rooms yet?! After their chores, the rambunctious group presents even more amazing mini-comics: a thrilling ride in "Chubbs McSpiderbutt," an action-packed romp in "Frogzilla," reflective haikus in "In the Autumn Pond," a candy-coated mystery in "Mallo Cop," and much, much more. By working together, the baby frogs discover that small things can have a huge impact. In this innovative graphic novel series, award-winning author and illustrator Dav Pilkey employs a variety of techniques -- including origami, acrylic paints, colored pencils, photography, collage, gouache, watercolors, and more -- to capture the creative and joyful spirit of collaboration. The variety of art styles, paired with Pilkey\'s trademark storytelling and humor, inspires imagination and innovation for readers of all ages.',

        'The newest graphic novel in the #1 bestselling series by Dav Pilkey, the author and illustrator of Dog Man! The Cat Kid Comic Club is in crisis! After learning that one of their comics will be published, the baby frogs are filled with anxiety and doubt. How will they get their creative groove back? Will Naomi or Melvin emerge as a leader? Will Flippy convince them to finally straighten up and fly right? The story is hysterical, thought-provoking, and full of action-packed mini-comics: "Frogzilla vs. Mechafrogzilla," "I Am Dr. Fredric Wertham," "Two Birds," and "RoboChubbs." Bestselling author-illustrator Dav Pilkey shows the reader that the best way to influence people is to be open, gentle, and kind. The variety of art styles, paired with Pilkey\'s trademark storytelling and humor, inspires imagination and innovation for readers of all ages. For more hilarity and heart, dive into the newest graphic novel in the Dog Man series: Dog Man: Twenty Thousand Fleas Under the Sea. And don\'t forget the series that started it all: Captain Underpants! A new edition of The Adventures of Captain Underpants includes a brand new Dog Man comic!',

        "Cat Kid Comic Club is back in session in this groundbreaking graphic novel narrative by Dav Pilkey, the worldwide bestselling and award-winning author and illustrator of Dog Man. Flippy, Molly, Li'l Petey, and twenty-one baby frogs each have something to say. Naomi and Melvin don't see eye to eye and Poppy perceives the world differently than her siblings. Will the baby frogs figure out how to work together and appreciate one another's point of view -- both inside and outside the classroom? The shenanigans are nonstop and the baby frogs' minicomics are funny and full of heart. Creating stories within a story, author and illustrator Dav Pilkey uses a variety of techniques -- including acrylic paints, colored pencils, Japanese calligraphy, photography, collage, gouache, watercolors, and much more -- to portray each frog's perspective. The kaleidoscope of art styles, paired with Pilkey's trademark storytelling and humor, fosters creativity, collaboration, independence, and empathy. Readers of all ages will relish this joyful graphic novel adventure.",

        "THE GREED OF GOLDFEVER: Captain Cat and the Umbrella Kid go for gold!! From a strawberry farm infested with North American Apache Attack snails; to hanging from a zeppelin high above Maxburg City; to a tropical isle guarded by Giant Robot Crabs, the Tremendous Two have no time to catch their breaths, let alone hold them. Someone’s made all the gold in the Lockstock Stockade Gold Depository smell Absolutely Stinky. But is this only the First Step in a pongy plot to plunder the gold vaults? Who can be behind it? Sultry saboteur Dinah Myte? Evil mad scientist Dr von Feendkraven? Surely it can’t be Eddie Goldfever the world famous rock star? Join the Captain and the Kid as they tackle head-on the all-consuming Greed of Goldfever! THE SARDINES OF SUSPICION: Captain Cat’s penthouse HQ is flooded and pumped full of piranha!! A seemingly unprovoked attack by gross gangster Fish-Face. But this is only a pulse-pounding prelude. Greater perils await...Beneath the dark, placid waters of the Squidd Sardine Farm something stirs. An enormous sardine-guzzling sea-serpent! But surely such things don’t exist? Captain Cat and the Umbrella Kid investigate *and discover Mystery upon Mystery. Who is the sinister man in black weaving a Tibetan ghost-trap around the lake? Who is the face-swapping traitor behind all the sabotage at the Sardine Farm? Diving-bells are attacked, Ye Olde Country Tea-Roomes are machine-gunned, and assorted heroes are sucked up by giant vacuum-cleaners before one thing is finally made clear: the Sardines of Suspicion cast their sinister shadow over everyone, and No One Can Be Trusted * not even Captain Cat!",

        "The Cat Kid Comic Club is deep in discovery in the newest graphic novel in the hilarious and heartwarming worldwide bestselling series by Dav Pilkey, the author and illustrator of Dog Man. The comic club is going in all different directions! Naomi, Melvin, and siblings are each trying to find their purpose. Naomi has an idea to get rich quick that causes a lot of commotion and emotion. And when faced with rejections, the friends try and try again to stay true to their vision. To top it off, a surprise visitor comes to class to stir things up. Will a desire for money and power cloud Naomi's purpose? Is it quitting time? Will the club ever be the same? The hilarity is nonstop as the baby frogs navigate sibling relationships, follow their path, and create art -- with purpose! Featured as stories-within-the-story, the mini comics showcase each baby frog's perspective and individual art style. In this groundbreaking graphic novel series, award-winning author and illustrator Dav Pilkey uses a variety of techniques -- including acrylic paints, colored pencils, photography, collage, gouache, watercolors, and much more -- to illustrate each frog's creative purpose and encourage teamwork. The kaleidoscope of art styles, paired with Pilkey's trademark storytelling and humor, fosters creativity, collaboration, independence, and empathy. Readers of all ages will enjoy this fun, exciting, and purposeful graphic novel adventure.",

        'A pioneering new graphic novel series by Dav Pilkey, the author and illustrator of the internationally bestselling Dog Man and Captain Underpants series. Naomi, Melvin, Pedro, and Poppy are just a few of the twenty-one rambunctious, funny, and talented baby frogs who share their stories in the Cat Kid Comic Club. Can Li\'l Petey, Molly, and Flippy help the students express themselves through comics? The adventures in class and on paper unwind with mishaps and hilarity as the creative baby frogs experience the mistakes and progress that come with practice and persistence. "Squid Kid and Katydid," "Baby Frog Squad," "Monster Cheese Sandwich," "Birds Flowers Trees: A Haiku Photo Comic," and other mini-comics are featured as stories-within-the-story, each done in a different style, utilizing humor and drama, prose and poetry, illustrated in different media including acrylics, pastels, colored pencils, felt-tip markers, clay, hand-made cardboard sculptures, photographs, pipe cleaners, construction paper collages, and cookies. This heartfelt, humorous, and thoughtful graphic novel by award-winning author and artist Dav Pilkey will have readers of all ages laughing and motivated to unleash their own creativity. Praise for Cat Kid Comic Club: ★ "Downright moving... it\'s a heartfelt celebration." -- Publishers Weekly, starred review ★ "Colorful, compelling, and laugh-out-loud funny." -- School Library Journal, starred review ★ "Wise, funny, and whiplash inducing: Pilkey delivers again." -- Kirkus Reviews, starred review When Dav Pilkey was a kid, he was diagnosed with ADHD and dyslexia. Dav was so disruptive in class that his teachers made him sit out in the hallway every day. Luckily, Dav loved to draw and make up stories. He spent his time in the hallway creating his own original comic books -- the very first adventures of Dog Man and Captain Underpants. In the second grade, Dav\'s teacher ripped up his comics and told him he couldn\'t spend the rest of his life making silly books. Fortunately, Dav was not a very good listener. Praise for Cat Kid Comic Club: *"Irreverent, laugh-out-loud funny and... downright moving, it\'s a heartfelt celebration of coming into one\'s own as an artist, with all its frustrations and joys." -- Publishers Weekly, starred review "Pilkey effectively mixes instruction and empowerment into the chaos, the frenetic panels... making both immensely enjoyable. Supa fun." -- Kirkus Reviews.',

The Cute Crazy Cat Story For Kids is a funny cat story. It is one of those funny cat stories adults might like, too. The main character is, of course, a cat, more precisely, a black kitten. From the cat's first day in his new family, we feel that life will not be the same for the kitten's adoptive family. Your kid and you, as parents, will have a lot of fun reading this cat story, and it might give you the desire to adopt a cat. It is for children from 3 to 7 years old.",

        'NOW A MAJOR MOTION PICTURE! "I wish I\'d had these books as a kid. Hilarious!" -- Dav Pilkey, creator of Captain Underpants and Dog Man hey may look like Bad Guys, but these wannabe heroes are doing good deeds... whether you like it or not in this New York Times bestselling illustrated series. OK. A lot of the stuff we said on the back of the last book was NOT TRUE. We now admit that The Bad Guys is WEIRD. We also admit that it features ALL the weird stuff we said it didn’t. PLUS there’s now a whole bunch of even weirder stuff* involving an over-sharing bat, a really scary new character who lives in the woods, and a strangely confident little guy with a mullet. So, uh, don’t relax, maybe FREAK OUT a little and have your MIND BLOWN by the BAD GUYS! *One of the other weird things in this book happens on pages 130-131. A total white-out—the most powerful blast this series has ever known. We told you it’s a weird book. And we hope you enjoy it!',

        'NOW A MAJOR MOTION PICTURE! "I wish I\'d had these books as a kid. Hilarious!" -- Dav Pilkey, creator of Captain Underpants and Dog Man They may look like Bad Guys, but these wannabe heroes are doing good deeds... whether you like it or not in this New York Times bestselling illustrated series. WEIRD?! Nothing weird EVER happens in The Bad Guys. Like, you would NEVER see a chain-saw monster confronting a velociraptor who has eaten an elderly piranha, or the disturbing antics of a deranged dentist running amok with an oversized drill. NOPE. None of that nonsense here. So relax and be entirely unsurprised by the Bad Guys’ next adventure!',

Joseph is not a lofty hero but an all-too-human businessman whose schemes fail ... who is no better than the rest of us, and like the rest of us, neither a good guy nor a bad guy." p.3',

His mom thinks video games are turning his brain to mush, so she wants her son to put down the controller and explore his “creative side.” As if that’s not scary enough, Halloween’s just around the corner and the frights are coming at Greg from every angle. When Greg discovers a bag of gummy worms, it sparks an idea. Can he get his mom off his back by making a movie . . . and will he become rich and famous in the process? Or will doubling down on this plan just double Greg’s troubles?",

      publishedDate: "2012-10-30",
      description:
        "The highly anticipated third book in the critically acclaimed and bestselling series takes the art of being wimpy to a whole new level. Let’s face it: Greg Heffley will never change his wimpy ways. Somebody just needs to explain that to Greg’s father. You see, Frank Heffley actually thinks he can get his son to toughen up, and he enlists Greg in organized sports and other “manly†? endeavors. Of course, Greg is able to easily sidestep his father’s efforts to change him. But when Greg’s dad threatens to send him to military academy, Greg realizes he has to shape up . . . or get shipped out. Greg and his family and friends, who make the Diary of a Wimpy Kid books a must-read for middle school readers, are back and at their best in this hilarious new installment of the series, which is sure to please current fans while attracting new ones. Publishers Weekly-1/19/2009: The third book in this genre-busting series is certain to enlarge Kinney’s presence on the bestseller lists, where the previous titles have taken up residence for the past two years. Kinney’s spot-on humor and winning formula of deadpan text set against cartoons are back in full force. This time, Greg starts off on New Year’s Day (he resolves to “help other people improve,†? telling his mother, “I think you should work on chewing your potato chips more quietly†?) and ends with summer vacation. As he fends off his father’s attempts to make him more of a man (the threat of military school looms), Greg’s hapless adventures include handing out anonymous valentines expressing his true feelings (“Dear James, You smell†?), attempting to impress his classmate Holly and single-handedly wrecking his soccer team’s perfect season. Kinney allows himself some insider humor as well, with Greg noting the “racket†? children’s book authors have going. “All you have to do is make up a character with a snappy name, and then make sure the character learns a lesson at the end of the book.†? Greg, self-centered as ever, may be the exception proving that rule. Ages 8†“12. (Jan.) F&P level: T",

        "A family road trip is supposed to be a lot of fun . . . unless, of course, you're the Heffleys. The journey starts off full of promise, then quickly takes several wrong turns. Gas station bathrooms, crazed seagulls, a fender bender, and a runaway pig—not exactly Greg Heffley's idea of a good time. But even the worst road trip can turn into an adventure—and this is one the Heffleys won't soon forget. The Diary of Wimpy Kid series of books, by best-selling author Jeff Kinney, charts the highs and lows of our middle school hero, Greg, as he stumbles and fumbles from childhood to teenhood via school-hood. Sometimes helped by his friends and family, often not helped by himself! Readers love The Diary of a Wimpy Kid Series. The USA Today, Publishers Weekly, Wall Street Journal, and # 1 New York Times bestsellers: 'In the publishing world, Kinney is a rock star.' NPR's 'Backseat Book Club' 'Diary of a Wimpy Kid is bent on world domination.' Time magazine 'One of the most successful children's series ever published.' Washington Post 'A big hit with reluctant readers and anyone looking for a funny book.' School Library Journal",

        "In the latest installment of the phenomenally bestselling Diary of a Wimpy Kid series, author-illustrator Jeff Kinney brings the series back to its roots, as Greg starts a new school year and faces a challenge he never could've imagined. Life was better in the old days. Or was it? That's the question Greg Heffley is asking as his town voluntarily unplugs and goes electronics-free. But modern life has its conveniences, and Greg isn't cut out for an old-fashioned world. With tension building inside and outside the Heffley home, will Greg find a way to survive? Or is going 'old school' just too hard for a kid like Greg? Readers love the Diary of a Wimpy Kid series – the USA Today, Publishers Weekly, Wall Street Journal, and #1 New York Times bestsellers: 'In the publishing world Kinney is a rock star.' NPR's 'Backseat Book Club' 'Diary of a Wimpy Kid is bent on world domination.' Time magazine 'One of the most successful children's series ever published.' Washington Post 'A big hit with reluctant readers and anyone looking for a funny book.' School Library Journal",

        "Jeff Kinney has brought Greg Heffley back for the ninth instalment of his bestselling Diary of a Wimpy Kid series. This time, the Heffleys are off on a road trip! The chances of survival are... quite small to be honest. If I had to guess, I'd say 90% of everything we do as a family comes from ideas Mom gets from that magazine. And when I saw the latest issue I knew it was gonna get Mom's wheels turning. When Greg's mom decides the family are going to have an 'authentic experience' this summer on a family road trip, Greg is less than excited. All the Heffley's trapped in a minivan for miles and miles... it spells disaster. And when Greg has to battle petrol-station bathrooms, crazed seagulls, a fender bender and a runaway pig, it seems he was right to be worried. This is one adventure the Heffleys won't forget! Reluctant and avid readers of 7+ can't get enough of Greg and the disasters that follow him around!",

It's not easy for me to think of ways to improve myself, because I'm pretty much one of the best people I know. Greg's dad, Frank, is on a mission. A mission to make this wimpy kid... well, less wimpy. All manner of 'manly' physical activities are planned, but Greg just about manages to find a way out of them. That is until military academy is mentioned, and Greg realises that he's going to have to come up with something very special to get out of this one... 7+ readers all over the world love reading about what scrapes and schemes Greg gets up to in his hilarious diaries. Full of pictures and giggles, they are the perfect gift, even for reluctant readers.

        "Get ready, book 10 in the phenomenally bestselling Diary of a Wimpy Kid series is coming! Life was better in the old days. Or was it? That's the question Greg Heffley is asking as his town voluntarily unplugs and goes electronics-free. But modern life has its conveniences, and Greg isn't cut out for an old-fashioned world. With tension building inside and outside the Heffley home, will Greg find a way to survive? Or is going 'old school' just too hard for a kid like Greg? Praise for Jeff Kinney: 'The world has gone crazy for Jeff Kinney's Diary of a Wimpy Kid' - Sun 'Kinney is right up there with J K Rowling as one of the bestselling children's authors on the planet' - Independent 'The most hotly anticipated children's book of the year is here - Diary of a Wimpy Kid' - Big Issue",

        "The Wish is a short, sharp, chilling story from Roald Dahl, the master of the shocking tale In The Wish, Roald Dahl, one of the world's favourite authors, tells a sinister story about the darker side of human nature. Here, an imaginative boy plays a game that quickly gets out of hand . . . The Wish is taken from the short story collection Someone Like You, which includes seventeen other devious and shocking stories, featuring the wife who serves a dish that baffles the police; a curious machine that reveals the horrifying truth about plants; the man waiting to be bitten by the venomous snake asleep on his stomach; and others. 'The absolute master of the twist in the tale.' (Observer ) This story is also available as a Penguin digital audio download read by the sublime Stephen Mangan. Roald Dahl, the brilliant and worldwide acclaimed author of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, James and the Giant Peach, Matilda, and many more classics for children, also wrote scores of short stories for adults. These delightfully disturbing tales have often been filmed and were most recently the inspiration for the West End play, Roald Dahl's Twisted Tales by Jeremy Dyson. Roald Dahl's stories continue to make readers shiver today.",

A Piece of Cake is taken from the short story collection Over to You, which includes nine other dramatic and terrifying tales of life as a wartime fighter pilot, and is drawn from Dahl's own experiences during the Second World War. This story is also available as a Penguin digital audio download read by Julian Rhind-Tutt. Roald Dahl, the brilliant and worldwide acclaimed author of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, James and the Giant Peach, Matilda, and many more classics for children, also wrote scores of short stories for adults. These delightfully disturbing tales have often been filmed and were most recently the inspiration for the West End play, Roald Dahl's Twisted Tales by Jeremy Dyson. Roald Dahl's stories continue to make readers shiver today.",

        "My Lady Love, My Dove is a short, sharp, frightening story from Roald Dahl, the master of the shocking tale. In My Lady Love, My Dove, Roald Dahl, one of the world's favourite authors, tells a sinister story about the darker side of human nature. Here, a game of cards between two couples is the basis for some shocking deceit . . . My Lady Love, My Dove is taken from the short story collection Someone Like You, which includes seventeen other devious and shocking stories, featuring the wife who serves a dish that baffles the police; a curious machine that reveals the horrifying truth about plants; the man waiting to be bitten by the venomous snake asleep on his stomach; and others. 'The absolute master of the twist in the tale.' (Observer) This story is also available as a Penguin digital audio download read by the great Richard Griffiths. Roald Dahl, the brilliant and worldwide acclaimed author of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, James and the Giant Peach, Matilda, and many more classics for children, also wrote scores of short stories for adults. These delightfully disturbing tales have often been filmed and were most recently the inspiration for the West End play, Roald Dahl's Twisted Tales by Jeremy Dyson.

In The Visitor, Roald Dahl, one of the world's favourite authors, tells a funny, fruity story about one of his favourite characters, adventurer and seducer Oswald Hendryks Cornelius. Here, Uncle Oswald gets more than he bargained for in Arabia . . . The Visitor is taken from the short story collection Switch Bitch, which includes three other black comedies which capture the ins and outs, highs and lows of sex (including another Uncle Oswald story, Bitch). 'One of the most widely read and influential writers of our generation.' (The Times ) This story is also available as a Penguin digital audio download read by Richard E. Grant and Derek Jacobi. Roald Dahl, the brilliant and worldwide acclaimed author of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, James and the Giant Peach, Matilda, and many more classics for children, also wrote scores of short stories for adults.

      description:
        "Taste is a short, sharp, disturbing story from Roald Dahl, the master of the shocking tale. In Taste, Roald Dahl, one of the world's favourite authors, tells a dark and curious story about the twisted side of human nature. Here, two men make an unusual and chilling wager over the provenance of a bottle of wine . . . Taste is taken from the short story collection Someone Like You, which includes seventeen other devious and shocking stories, featuring the wife who serves a dish that baffles the police; a curious machine that reveals the horrifying truth about plants; the man waiting to be bitten by the venomous snake asleep on his stomach; and others. 'The absolute master of the twist in the tale.' (Observer ) This story is also available as a Penguin digital audio download read by the inimitable Richard E. Grant. Roald Dahl, the brilliant and worldwide acclaimed author of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, James and the Giant Peach, Matilda, and many more classics for children, also wrote scores of short stories for adults. These delightfully disturbing tales have often been filmed and were most recently the inspiration for the West End play, Roald Dahl's Twisted Tales by Jeremy Dyson. Roald Dahl's stories continue to make readers shiver today.",
